# Vina-AI TWP-Ω Integration Demonstration

This project demonstrates the integration of the TruthWeave Omega (TWP-Ω) framework into a simulated Vina-AI chatbot environment.

## How to Run the Demonstration

### 1. Install Dependencies

First, you need to install the required Python libraries. You can do this using `pip` and the `requirements.txt` file:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Run the Main Script

Once the dependencies are installed, you can run the demonstration script:

```bash
python main.py
```

You will see output in your terminal that shows the simulated process:

1.  A user query is received.
2.  Multiple AI models (ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude) are called.
3.  Their answers are processed by the TWP-Ω framework.
4.  A final, high-confidence answer is generated and displayed.
